# App Description

This app is a physical activity tracker that identifies the type of activity (eg. walking, running, cycling) and provides useful statistics to the user such as the calories they've burned, the distance they've travelled and how much more they need to exercise to achieve certain goals.

The app utilisies external IoT components through its use of built-in sensors. This includes a Motion detector and Vibration thingy.

The actionable insight is achieved through Alerts embedded throughout the app. The Alert informs the user of the progress they made and the "next steps" they need to action to achieve their daily goal. For example, "You've walked 1k, you need to walk 2k to reach your goal of 3k!".

The non-IoT component is achieved through ...

Our team's initial planning of the app can be found [here](https://myvuwac-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jaymejoan_myvuw_ac_nz/EXBOcLf7DhpMh6hCYpPeLJ8BCIGPOzCHU-kek1MzQ-gieA?e=4HftaS). We also used Gitlab's issue tracking feature to create and assign issues. This allowed our team to work efficiently and keep track of our progress to ensure we completed the project on time. It also provided a clear representation of each of our teammates contributions.
